# Team10Project
Welcome to Team 10s project repository. Here you will find all of the artifacts, presentations, documentation, and source code for our SWE 3313 class project.

Throughout the remainder of the semester we will be working on a small e-commerce website using Swing, Java, and SQL to sell every computer part possible.

Below you will find links of everything that you need to know about the project, and the team who is working on it.
